# Road-Semantic-Segmentation
This project focuses on semantic segmentation for road scenes using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles, robotics, and computer vision applications. The goal is to accurately classify and segment different road elements such as lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
